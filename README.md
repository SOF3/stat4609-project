# stat4609-project
This is the course project conducted by @jevrii, @kellycyy and me.
The project studies the [Netflix Prize dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data),
developing three models (kNN, SVD and NCF) to predict ratings.

The project report can be found at [report.pdf](./report.pdf).
Code implementations are found in the following files:

- kNN: `knn_full_submit.ipynb`
- SVD: `svd_full_submit.ipynb`
- NCF: `ncf_with_full_dataset.ipynb`
- GMF: `gmf_with_full_dataset.ipynb`

Since this project is only of technical interest of demonstrating different models,
we did not try to push the test RMSE to its best.
The best result we obtained was only around $0.87$.
